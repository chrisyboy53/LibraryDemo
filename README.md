# A nice introduction to DotNetCore

This is a simple demo to getting into DotNet Core

# Getting Started

The core technology used here is `DotNetCore`, `Microsoft.ASPNetCore`, and `AngularJS`.

This demo uses the `Startup` class to help startup MVC, and custom services used in the
controllers.

To begin using the application for the **first time**. Open up a terminal and type

``` bash

npm install

dotnet restore

dotnet run

```

This will get the application loaded with all the required dependencies, built, and running.

## Required step to watch for

Pay attention to the output from the terminal to see what the URL is for the hosted application.

usually is

`http://localhost:5000/`

however the port number could change.

Ensure you are using the correct path to access the API as well.
